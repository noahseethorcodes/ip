```

```

### 3. Add an Event

Add an event with a start and end date/time.

```

```

---

### 4. View Tasks

List all current tasks in the order they were added or sorted.

```
list
```

Output:

```
Here‚Äôs your current tasks:
1. [T][ ] Finish CS2103T tutorial
2. [D][ ] Submit lab report (by: Oct 05 2025, 11:59 PM)
...
```

---

### 5. Mark / Unmark Tasks

Mark a task as done or not done.

```
mark 1
unmark 1
```

---

### 6. Delete Tasks

Remove a task by its task number.

```
delete 2
```

---

### 7. Find Tasks

Search for tasks containing a keyword.

```
find project
```

Output will show only matching tasks, but the **task numbers are preserved from the full list**.
This means you can use the displayed index directly with other commands like `mark`, `unmark`, or `delete` without confusion.

Example:

```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
3. [D][ ] Submit project report (by: Oct 05 2025, 11:59 PM)
5. [E][ ] Project meeting (from: Oct 03 2025, 2:00 PM to: 4:00 PM)
```

If you now run:

```
mark 3
```

‚Ä¶it will mark **task #3 in the full list** as done.

---

### 8. Sort Tasks

Sort tasks so that:

* Todos come first
* Deadlines follow, sorted by date
* Events come last, sorted by start time, then end time

```
sort
```

---

### 9. Exit the Program

Quit the chatbot.

```
bye
```

---
